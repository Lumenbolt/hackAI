# Temperature Alert Agent

This Python program uses the uAgents library to connect to a weather API, fetch the real-time temperature for a specified location, and send an alert to the user when the temperature goes below or above a specified threshold.

To run this program, you will need to install the uAgents library. You can do this by running the following command in a terminal:

"
pip install uagents
"

Once you have installed the uAgents library, you can run the program by typing the following command in a terminal:

"
python temperature_alert_agent.py
"

The program will then start monitoring the temperature for the specified location. If the temperature goes below or above the specified threshold, the program will send an alert to the user.
